ÿ#Hi, this is an example of my new cool control - CoolForm!

When the form is loaded, the mouse it trapped inside the window. This is done instead of using 
"Form.show vbModal", in order to force the user to close the form before moving on in the 
application.

PLEASE NOTE:
You must remove the remark from the line "Call MouseCapture" inside the 
event "UserControl_Show", before the compilation. DO NOT do this while you are coding, otherwise 
the mouse will be trapped and you will be stucked!

MORE SPECIAL FEATURES:
- It traps the mouse when it´s open
- It releases the trapped mouse when it´s minimized (green button, or dubbelclick on captiontext)
- It stays on top when it´s minimized (green button, or dubbelclick on captiontext)
- It does not act like the common VB-forms

I wrote this ActiveX, because I needed a nice form for fixed forms, and hopfully you could use it to 
where you might need it. Microsoft´s standard forms inside VB looks so boring now after a couple 
of years :-)
